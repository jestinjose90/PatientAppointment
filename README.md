#Title : Asian Health Clinic
#Summary
#The name of my web application is Asian Health Clinic .  I thought of creating a Patient appointment system to simulate the functions performed by everyone in a clinic. This application focuses  on creating appointments for patients. Users are employees that work in Asian Clinic . Admin has more privileges than users . The Home Page would allow user/ admin to login if they register by creating an account or are already a registered member .
#A User will be able to add patients and they can add appointment schedules   for each patient . Patient data added will be  displayed  in another page where the user can view , edit, or delete .An admin can do the functions of users and in addition can insert the availability schedule . He/she can add , edit, or remove physicians’ data  from clinic application  and add their available hours.

#Design Specifications
#I preferred a professional theme because it’s a clinic website. It focuses more on content . I want users to easily navigate to web app and create the appointment without much time consumption. My web application has navigation menu ,  forms, and a table. Navigation menu shows the actions of different functions . Forms are used to add patients , available hours, and physicians’ data. I used a tabular and card format for displaying data added by both admin and user.

#Future Work
#There is no search bar for my current application . A search bar would allow users/ admin to easily find the patient or physicians’  data  rather than scrolling through a long list. For either of these, I would need to add a search API or add another controller for my web application.
